title: About this blog
---

This site was created to help me learn the **Swift Language** and **iOS** development. I intend to keep track of my goals and progress, as well as, documenting helpful resources I come across or use often.  

The blog was created with Jekyll straight from a [lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com) tutorial -> **Jekyll for Web Designers** by James Williamson.  It's a great course & I didn't make many changes to the design.  

### About the Author

My name is Doug Harper. I'm an app developer who got started around the time Swift was announced and decided to make it my focus.  Previously I developed websites and still do occasional work on them.  I love working in both areas and enjoy learning and building new things.  My favorite form of communication is Twitter, please say hello at [@endodoug](https://twitter.com/endodoug "my twitter profile").
