I've been working on a few websites the past several months.  It's been a while and I forgot how much work goes into a site, even after it's been launched.  Not to mention 3 at the same time.  

The decision was made to go with wordpress for several reasons, mainly ease-of-operation if/when the client want's to run them.  I also made the very wise choice to use the [Genesis Framework]() for consistency in quality themes.  

### Mitosol
My client's main product is an industry-standard drug for glaucoma surgery.  They were previously getting no organic traffic for their product, now we are ranking #1 for google search results for all relevant keywords and starting to expand into a few other areas for capturing traffic.  [Mitosol](http://mitosol.com "Mitosol") is now delivering contacts to sales, medical affairs, and the corporate office.
