I am starting a complete overhaul of [Magical Forest Memory Match](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magical-forest-memory-match/id984939318?ls=1&mt=8 "Magical Forest Memory Match"), which I made as a SpriteKit learning project.  Currently, it's a simple one scene memory game that tracks your best score.  There's not much to it, but my 3 yr-old likes it and asks for it specifically.  So, my plan is to make a few more levels with the art work I currently have.  

Here's the plan (Phase 1):

* Create a Main Menu scene
* Create a Game Over scene
* Add 4 new levels 3 easier, 1 more difficult than my current scene
* Kid-ify it a bit with some additional juice
* Add some more acheivements
* Remove a bug in the current game - reshuffle after complete game
