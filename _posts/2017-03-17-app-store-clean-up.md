I've got a few games published on the App Store that have been neglected & users are getting the dreaded...

It's so unappealing and then Apple twists the knife with..

I get it.  So I'm pulling those apps from the app store until I can get them properly updated.  Honestly, I like that Apple does this kind of thing.  

### Apps Pulled Tonight

- Caribbean Catch -> My plan is to totally remake this ole girl with Swift.  The music is great and the art still holds up.  
- Flappy Red Skull -> My mandatory Flappy Bird knockoff.  No reason to put this guy back up.
- Marco Polo Word Search -> Great game, but niche never took off.  Probably never to be seen again.
- Orange is the New Black Word Search -> Consistent money maker.  Priority to get this one back up before OITNB Season 5 hits Neflix.
- July 4th Word Search -> Since Trump was elected this guy has been getting some action. Probably gets some new content and back in the lineup.  

### March 24th Update

The July 4th Word Search game has been updated, approved and back on the App Store.  The process was pretty smooth, although I do not enjoy working with Obj-C.  I made a few minor tweaks to overall look and feel of the game which took a little more time than I anticipated, but added some nice improvements.
