Starting a brief Journal documenting the progress of a new game that I'm building for Apple TV.  I've been following a tutorial from Justin Dike at [CartoonSmart](http://cartoonsmart.com/ref/511/ "CartoonSmart") and building a two-player tank battle type game.  Currently, the code is complete... for the most part, I'll make some tweaks as I move forward.  I've also got some art work ready and now it's time to put it all together. 

## Tank Battle Game
I chose to build a classic tank battle game for several reasons, here's the list
* Learn the in's and out's of preparing an app for the AppleTV
* Expand/Practice Swift and SpriteKit
* Become familiar with tvOS
* Connect external controllers
