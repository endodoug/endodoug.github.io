Starting a brief Journal documenting the progress of a new game that I'm building for Apple TV.  I've been following a tutorial from Justin Dike at [CartoonSmart](http://cartoonsmart.com/ref/511/ "CartoonSmart") and building a two-player tank battle type game.  Currently, the code is complete... for the most part, I'll make some tweaks as I move forward.  I've also got some art work ready and now it's time to put it all together.

## Tank Battle Game
I chose to build a classic tank battle game for several reasons, here's the list...
* Learn the in's and out's of preparing an app for the AppleTV
* Expand/Practice Swift and SpriteKit
* Become familiar with tvOS
* Connect external controllers
 
## Todo List
* Hook up the "Lives" left labels and set it up as images instead of labels
* Include a wins counter that updates as a new level is presented
* Find and add in the proper sound effects
* Complete 5 levels and a game over menu
* Add in Fabric
* Ad in Game Center Achievements
* Marketing artwork
* Game Description (outsource)
