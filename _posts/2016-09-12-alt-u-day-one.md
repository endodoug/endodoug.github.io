It's been a couple weeks since I attended Five Pack Creative's Alt-U iOS Journeyman course and I want to revisit some of the material and keep it fresh in my mind.  Writing it down helps me more than just reading over it.  

## Alt-U Day One

We started off talking about what it takes to move from an apprentice iOS Developer to a journeyman... the ability to take an idea and turn it into an app.  Tons of changes can happen along the way so the best way to handle all the change is through  an agile/iterative process:
* Define requirements 
* Develop to the requirments - breaks down big tasks to small pieces
* Deliver what you develop
* Communicate clearly and gather feedback
* Use feedback to generate additional requirements 

This is called an iteration and can be repeated as needed until you decide the product is ready to ship.  To add some predictability to the process you introduce SCRUM: 
* Story or User Story (requirements) - describes a feature or expectation of functionality. Keep it small.
* Acceptance Criteria - important part of any good story, details exactly what is needed (tested) for the story to be completed.
* Epic - a story that is too large to work on.
* Backlog - a list of stories for a project, should probably be prioritized.
* Sprint - prioritize backlog stories are added to a sprint, which is a well defined period of time.
* Points - arbitrary team measurement of the story's difficulty.  Points are used to determine the amount of work a team is likely to complete.  Does not necessarily equate to hours of days.
* Velocity - measures points over time to help business plan a release date.

Start writing stories from what can be seen (design, description, etc...), talk about assumptions to get a clear picture of what to develop. Set up a sprint that includes some functionality, deliver it, start the feeback loop and repeat until you have a completed product.

Next we reviewed and discussed Git version control.  Everyone in the class had a good enough working knowledge so we didn't go into great detail, but we spent some time covering the pro's and con's of using rebase.  FivePackCreative uses BitBucket and Tower for version control, but I was using the Source Control built into Xcode without issue.  
> Tip - Stashes are useful for new ideas that may not be implemented at the current time, but worth saving for the future
