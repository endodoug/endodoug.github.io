My newest app **MMA Quotes** was approved this morning so that’s a good starting point for this blog.  I still have several updates that need to be added before releasing in the US, and they are all things I must learn on my own.  

I started MMA Quotes as a learning project, coding along a tutorial by Daniel Autenrieth.  My goals starting off…

* Learn more about Core Data
* Learn how to implement iCloud features
* Get a nice looking app into my portfolio

Along the way I added a few more…

* Implement 3d touch with a Quick Menu item or two
* Experiment with the release
* Include Twitter’s Fabric
* Make it super nichee and try it out on a paid model

I got to a `Minimum Viable Product` stage and it’s been released in Australia, Canada and Costa Rica.  Maybe I’ll get a few reviews and learn something.  I remember hearing a speaker at our [Dallas App Developer Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Dallas-App-Developers "Dallas App Developers") mention the optimal update time was every 3 weeks, so I’ll be submitting version 1.1 for review on Feb 26th.   Here’s my current list of items to add/improve…

### Version 1.1 Update

* Onboarding 
* Quick Menu item to add a new quote
* iPhone App Preview
* Preload 3 or 4 quotes
* Add a contact option to the menu
* Tweak ASO 

### Version 1.2 Update

* Submit March 18
* Localize for Brazil
* Tweak ASO
* Evaluate reviews
