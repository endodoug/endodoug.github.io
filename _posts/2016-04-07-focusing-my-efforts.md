A short post to update a few basic priorities and goals.  I will continue to do these until May 15th and then revisit and evaluate my progress.  

## Short Term Goals
* Learn Autolayout & Stack Views Inside and Out.
* Become Very Good with Playgrounds.

## How To Get There
* Complete autolayout for **every** project I work on, no matter how small. Every third one should be constraints by code.
* Complete a playground for each tutorial project I work on.
* Continue working with Erica's book.
* Contribute to 3 OS playgrounds.
