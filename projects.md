I've been working on iOS apps since June of 2014 and published more than 10 in the App Store.  Here's a few of my recent apps and a couple other projects I enjoyed working on.  [iOS Apps by Doug Harper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/doug-harper/id885299622 "iOS Apps by Doug Harper")

## Mobius Therapeutics

I started working for Mobius in the second half of 2016 and published their Custom B2B app in October.  The app allows their outside sales to work more efficiently by giving them access to sales material on their mobile device.  All sales material, forms and news items are easily emailed or printed whenever needed.  Custom app utilizing the power of Split View Controllers.

## Pocket Ninja Stickers
When iOS 10 was released I think every developer made at least one Sticker Pack for iMessages.  It was super easy and fun, although my paid strategy may not have been wise.  This guy features a couple animated ninjas to release at the appropiate time.  

## MMA Quotes 

Super versatile quote library that allows you to create your own quotes and share them via social media. It includes a facial recogition feature that pulls the author/fighter image from Wikipedia and adds it to your quote.  With the release of iOS 10 I introduced a Today Widget which shows random qoutes from your collection on the lock screen, which added immense value to the app.  Made with Swift, Core Data, iCloud, Today Extension.

## Orange is the New Black - Word Search

One of my first apps.  I went for a super-nichey theme based on the Netflix show, which turned out to be a good strategy.  OITNB Word Search reached #1 for Word Games in the App Store and was featured in several different countries and categories.  This app is currently still available, but needs an update before we kick off next season.  Written in Obj-C because Swift was available at the time.

## Magical Forest Memory Match 

I am currently working to add more features to this cute little game.  Initially a learning project that I'm revisiting because my 3 year old is always asking to play... why not improve it for him and see if other kids think the same.  I love the art work and actually put the soundtrack together on my own.  Created with SpriteKit.
