I've been working on iOS apps since June of 2014 and published more than 10 in the App Store.  Here's a few of my recent apps and a couple other projects I enjoyed working on. 

## Mobius Therapeutics

I started working for Mobius in the second half of 2016 and published their Custom B2B app in October.  The app allows their outside sales to work more efficiently by giving them access to sales material on their mobile device.  All sales material, forms and news items are easily emailed or printed whenever needed.
